# Shoes Website - ["WHAT ARE THOSE?!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNtz05bhI1k)

This is a fun side project I made (of course.. because who doesn't like new shoes)
This is a prototype of a website that a Shoe Company might use to show of their kicks.  

For this project, I wanted to ramp up my CSS skills and use a new technology - SASS.  

Knowing that typical CSS Stylesheets can get *quite* large, SASS seemed to be the way to go as it can handle large, more complex stylesheet architecture (variables, mixins, functions, parent-sibling css - a.k.a. inheritance, [browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/transforms3d), etc)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)(scss => css) 
- JavaScript
- Google Font API
